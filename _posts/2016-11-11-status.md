title: Monster Fuelled Update
tags: [status, random-update, blog]

Currently working on this site after a successful monster fuelled attempt at completing my assignments. I also managed to crash [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv) on the SANIC server so.. thats a thing. It looks like redirecting the ssl port to 8989 will make Sonarr implode and die a painful glen-like death - who knew (also R.I.P. Glen). Note to self: fix Sonarr before the next episode of Star Wars Rebels. Anyways I don't really know what i'm going to do with this jekyl based version of the site, probably move it to a blog subdomain or something, but at the moment I'm wheey to lazy to make a real site.

P.S. Happy Remembrance Day - Lest We Forget. <img src="http://www.legion.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Poppy_2COL-250x245.png"></img>
