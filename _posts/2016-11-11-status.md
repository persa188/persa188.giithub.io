Currently working on this site after a successful monster fuelled attempt at completing my assignments. I also managed to crash [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv) on the SANIC server so.. thats a thing as well, it looks like redirecting the ssl port to 8989 will conflict and crash it forever - who knew. Note to self: fix Sonarr before the next episode of Star Wars Rebels.

P.S. Happy Remembrance Day - Lest We Forget.
