Ever since I took the security course at [UTSC](https://utsc.utoronto.ca) I've been attempting to serve all my applications more securely. Don't believe me? Ask the little green lock in your address bar, he'll tell you. At this point you're probably thinking "bruh this guy paid for a ssl cert ... for a crappy test blog site lel" - And to that I say "nah bruh I got it for free @cloudflare"

Which is basically why I wrote this post. I mean that and I'm bored af.
