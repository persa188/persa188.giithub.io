        Some of your info is collected by default by <b>google-analytics</b> so

        use it to provide a better site experience. I, however, respect your privacy
        so if your browser sends a <b> do not track </b> request the google-analytics
        script will not be executed and you will not be tracked (unless my code
        is incorrect/buggy in which case contact me and i'll fix it ASAP).
